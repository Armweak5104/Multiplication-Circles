# Multiplication-Circles
The program has assigned values to different points and then multiplies the value of one point by a factor n which draws a line to the next point of the corresponding value and this process is repeated again and again, move your mouse around to vary the factor n and the number of points.  *If you want to run the code run it on https://codepen.io/Armweak/pen/WNMWYjm as it has some pre-downloaded libraries needed (just copy paste the code) remeber to fork your own version so you dont interfere with the public template
